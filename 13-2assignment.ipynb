    "We use the Exception class as the base class for creating custom exceptions because it provides the basic functionality required for an exception, such as printing a traceback, raising the exception, and handling it. The Exception class is designed to be subclassed, allowing programmers to create their own custom exceptions that inherit all the functionality of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a custom exception, we can define additional attributes and methods that are specific to our use case. By using the Exception class as the base class, we ensure that our custom exception follows the same interface and behavior as other exceptions in the language. This makes it easier to handle and catch our custom exception along with other built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions provides consistency and standardization in the language. It ensures that all exceptions adhere to a common interface and can be handled uniformly by programs. This makes it easier for developers to write robust and maintainable code.\n",

    "Overall, using the Exception class as the base class for creating custom exceptions provides a solid foundation and structure for building exceptions that are consistent, maintainable, and easy to use."
