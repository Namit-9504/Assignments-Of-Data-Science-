    "Overfitting and underfitting are common problems in machine learning where the model either fails to generalize well to new, unseen data or oversimplifies the data to the point of being ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely, including noise and irrelevant information. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting include poor generalization and low accuracy on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The model fails to capture the complexity of the relationship between input and output, resulting in high bias and poor performance both on training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves stopping the training process when the model starts to overfit on the training data. Data augmentation is the process of artificially increasing the size of the training data by applying random transformations to the original data.\n",
