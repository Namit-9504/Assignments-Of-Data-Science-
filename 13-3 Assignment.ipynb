    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare the means of two or more groups of data. ANOVA assumes the following:\n",

    "1. Independence: The data within each group should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normality: The data should be normally distributed within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homogeneity of variance: The variances of the groups should be equal.\n",

    "4. Samples are in dependent and random\n",

    "If any of these assumptions are violated, the results of ANOVA may not be valid.\n",

    "Examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results are:\n",

    "Violation of independence: If the data within the groups are not independent, the results of ANOVA will be invalid. For example, if the same group of participants is used in multiple treatments, this would violate the independence assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of normality: If the data within the groups are not normally distributed, the results of ANOVA may not be valid. For example, if the data are skewed, the results may not accurately reflect the differences between groups.\n",

    "Violation of homogeneity of variance: If the variances of the groups are not equal, the results of ANOVA may not be valid. For example, if the data in one group has much larger variance than the data in another group, this could impact the results.\n",

    "In summary, ANOVA is a powerful statistical tool for comparing means between groups. However, it is important to ensure that the assumptions of independence, normality, and homogeneity of variance are met to ensure that the results are valid.

If the data are missing at random, meaning the reason for the missing data is unrelated to the values of the missing observations or to the outcome of the study, then the missing data can be handled using methods such as mean imputation or multiple imputation. However, if the data are missing not at random, meaning the reason for the missing data is related to the values of the missing observations or to the outcome of the study, then the missing data should not be imputed, and other methods such as maximum likelihood estimation should be used to account for the missing data.\n",

Mean imputation, for example, can lead to biased estimates and standard errors, and can reduce statistical power. Multiple imputation can be more effective, but requires more computation time and may be less appropriate for small sample sizes. Maximum likelihood estimation is generally considered the most appropriate method for handling missing data not at random, but may be more difficult to implement and may require more assumptions about the missing data mechanism.

They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post- hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
