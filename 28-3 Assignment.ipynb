    " Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty to the sum of the squared coefficients in the model. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely, which can help to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) is a type of linear regression that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. OLS does not add any penalty to the coefficients, which means that the model is free to fit the training data as closely as possible.\n",

    "The main difference between Ridge regression and OLS is that Ridge regression penalizes the coefficients, while OLS does not. This means that Ridge regression is less likely to overfit the training data than OLS."

    "- Linearity: This assumption means that the relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable can be represented by a straight line. This is a fairly common assumption in regression analysis, and it is usually not a problem if the data is not perfectly linear.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: This assumption means that the variance of the residuals is the same for all values of the predictor variables. This assumption is important because it ensures that the model is not overfitting the data. If the variance of the residuals is not constant, then the model may be fitting the noise in the data instead of the underlying relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable.\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: This assumption means that the predictor variables are not perfectly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can occur when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. This can make it difficult for the model to estimate the coefficients of the predictor variables, and it can also lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- Normality: This assumption means that the residuals are normally distributed. This assumption is not as important as the other assumptions, but it is still a good idea to check for normality if possible. If the residuals are not normally distributed, then the results of Ridge regression may not be reliable."
