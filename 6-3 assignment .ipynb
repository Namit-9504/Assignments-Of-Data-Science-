Different statistical methods are appropriate for different levels of measurement, and using the wrong statistical analysis can lead to inaccurate results and conclusions.\n",

    "For example, let's consider two variables, one measured at the ordinal level and the other at the ratio level. If we want to compare the average values of these two variables, we cannot use the t-test because it assumes that the data is measured at the interval or ratio level. Instead, we need to use a non-parametric test, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, which is appropriate for ordinal data.\n",
