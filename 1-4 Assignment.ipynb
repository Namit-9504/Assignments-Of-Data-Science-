    "Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x) as a linear function.

    " Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. Regularization helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function that discourages the model from becoming too complex.\n",
